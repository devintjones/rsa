That's the most curious kitty I've ever seen.
You haven't seen many of them then?
Legend has it that curious cats tend to die off. 
"Curiosity kills the cat, but satisfaction saved it.

No one ever remembers the full quote."
"Is that really how it goes? It's not that I don't remember it, I've never heard it before."

You've cat to be kitten me ;)
Only two comments in and already this pun thread's clawing for air.
"""How the...""

""SCREW YOU I DON'T LIKE THIS WITCHCRAFT"""
water go down the hole
"My cat is obsessed with my toilet. So much so that when he's bored, he actually flushes the toilet *just to watch it go.*

I have to keep the door closed or else it'll always be going, and if he's in there with me, stop him from reaching up next to me and flushing it while I'm still on it."
Mine does that too! I can't figure out why he is so perplexed by it all
"Many moons in, and here I am.  The room of the magic water.  

It spins and disappears and mysteriously reappears. Where does it go?  Why doesn't it take me with it?  

I've grown tired of this wizard; I need this portal, but it has yet to take me when I've offered it my paw or whiskers or the gift of my squeak baits.  

The wizard has bewitched the magic water, I feel certain.  I will remain watchful, in the absence of the human, until the portal can be opened again.  I fear the elusive red dot is the key to my transition to my other-worldly home, but it eludes me and escapes my grasp.

I must wait, remaining fastidious in my hygiene, in the ways of my brethren of the feline realm until I can incapacitate my human captor."

The cat OP posted is in this video
This is so cute!  My sister used to have a cat that actually used the toilet and then flushed!  
I believe that's called witchcraft.
Shushhh!  Don't tell anyone!
The opening scene from Rise of The Planet of The Cats.
You have to give him credit tho that was pretty cool.
"""He's a cat! (meow!) Flushing a toilet~"""
God i forgot about that. Its so 2010
Why do cats find that so fascinating?
"Cat says: ""Why don't humans find that so fascinating?"""
This is so cute and funny at the same time I can't handle it.
My cat's litter box was right next to the toilet. He watched and complained when I scoped out his poop and flushed it. 
WAT?
Wtf is that my cat? No joke
"my fucking cat every day, then he blocks the door until I flush the toilet for him again."
"That's me when I was 2 years old. 

My dad would make fun of me later and tell people that I liked to play with poop but I WASN'T! I was just wondering where the damn water went...

Okay, maybe now and then I got real curious about buoyancy of said brown clusters that would come out of my butt!"
Its liddo pawsss doe!
"Great title, it's like the cat really does say ""how?"" lol."
Are u kitten me right meow?
"""De fuck did it go? Do it again!"""
"""But...that was a *perfectly* good dead goldfish! Why would you waste it like that?!"""
My cat used to run across the house to look into the toilet when I flushed.  Then it grew old and boring :(
